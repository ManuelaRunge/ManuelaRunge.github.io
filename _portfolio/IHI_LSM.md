title: "Modelling larviciding deployment strategies"
excerpt: "Objectives of this project were to simulate varying larviciding deployment strategies and to determine coverage thresholds for targeting larvae vs adult mosquitoes.<br/><img src='/images/IMAG5631.jpg'>"

During my PhD studies I had the opportunity to visit the Ifakara Health Institute to learn more about Anopheles breeding sites,
 since I was investigating the impact of larviciding in simulation models. 
The work  led to two poster presentations and a manuscript is in preparation.
