I am a malaria epidemiologist with a public health background and trained in applied mathematical modelling. 

About me
======
I enjoy working in interdisciplinary teams and one of the most valuable experience in that regard was my time in Tanzania.
Check out my [CV](https://manuelarunge.github.io/cv/) here. 

Research interests
======
My research interests are mainly centered around data-driven and evidence-based decision making for targeted deployment of control interventions. 
More specifically I used mathematical modelling to support the national malaria strategic plan in Tanzania. 
Check out my [publications](https://manuelarunge.github.io/publications/) here.
