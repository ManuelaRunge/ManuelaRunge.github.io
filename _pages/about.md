Hello, thank you for stopping by. 
<br/>

My name is Manuela Runge, I am an infectious disease epidemiologist and passionate about data analysis in health-related research.
Many diseases and advserse health outcomes are preventable and, or treatable - that is what drives me in my work. 
I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, 
to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. 

Most of my experience has been in malaria research in Sub-Saharan Africa, while I also have worked on projects related to Neglected Tropical Diseases (Onchocerciasis, Lymphatic filariasis), COVID-19, West-Nile-Virus and Measles. 
My international (in-country) work experience includes Germany, Switzerland, Tanzania, and the US. 

Since 2022, I am company owner of **Runge Infectious Disease Research Analytics (RIDA)** (website coming soon).
My main work position is at [MM Global Health Consulting](https://www.mmglobalhealth.org/), I have the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects all dedicated to tackle the burden of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [NU malaria modeling group](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/) at Northwestern University, Chicago, USA, and I am still working in collaboration with the team on exciting malaria modeling projects.
I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc.'s degree in Epidemiology from the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) and University of Basel, Switzerland.
I received a B.Sc. in [Health Sciences at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/university/faculty-of-life-sciences/departments/health-sciences/).
