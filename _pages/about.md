Dr Manuela Runge is a postdoctoral fellow in the [NU malaria modeling group](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/) at Northwestern University, Chicago, USA. 
She received her PhD and MSc in Epidemiology from the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) and University of Basel, Switzeland.
She studied Health Sciences at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg as her undergraduate. 
<br/>

Most of her research focused on malaria in Tanzania, where she was part of the study team for a nation-wide School Malaria Parasitaemia Survey. 
During her PhD, she provided mathematical modelling support to the National Malaria Control Programme in Tanzania. 
The modelling support included the use of modelling for strategic planning by using country data for district-specific impact predictions of malaria control interventions. 
Dr Runge participated in several stakeholder meetings for the revision of the national malaria control strategic plan in Tanzania. 
<br/>

The close collaboration with the Tanzanian program, and recently interactions with the Illinois Department of Public Health provided her with insights into local policy and how modelling outputs can be of value in the decision making process. 
In her current position, she works on COVID-19 transmission and disease modeling in Illinois, USA as well as on estimating the impact of intermittent preventive therapies in infants in Nigeria.
