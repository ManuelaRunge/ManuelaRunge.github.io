I am an infectious disease epidemiologist specialized on malaria epidemiology and applied mathematical modelling. 
My PhD research focused on the use of modelling for strategic planning by using country data for district-specific 
impact predictions of malaria control interventions in close collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme in Tanzania.
I participated in several stakeholder meetings for the revision of the national malaria control strategic plan.
The dynamic and interdisciplinary teamwork with the Tanzanian program managers provided me with insights into local policy and real life contexts; 
and how modelling outputs can be of use in these contexts. 



About me
======
During my intern in patient care in the Marienhospital in Stuttgart in 2011, I developed a interest in public health, to ideally prevent individuals to even have to come to the hospital in the first place.
Probably a too ambitious goal, however it led me to study health sciences for my undergraduate. After that I then decided to study Epidemiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. 
During the masters I focused on infectious diseases, malaria in particular. 
As a student intern I went to Tanzania, in 2015, to work with the National Malaria Control Program which at the time planned a first nationwide school malaria survey. 
I worked  for a bit as a scientific assistant to finish work on the survey in Tanzania before I started my PhD in 2016. 
During my PhD I got into mathematical modelling, and I used modelling to support the national malaria control plan in Tanzania. 
Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Northwestern University at the [nummalaria modelling team](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/) in Prof Jaline Gerardins lab.

Research interests
======
My research interests are centered around data-driven and evidence-based decision making for targeted deployment of control interventions. 
More specifically I used mathematical modelling to support the national malaria strategic plan in Tanzania.

Other interests 
===== 
I am interested in exploring new tools, new tips for enhanced productivity and efficiency. 
Apart from that, I am a passionate about diving, the ocean, table tennis, fiction books and organizing sub-folders.
