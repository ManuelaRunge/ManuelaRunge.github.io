I am an infectious disease epidemiologist specialized on malaria epidemiology and applied mathematical modelling. 
My PhD research focused on the use of modelling for strategic planning by using country data for district-specific 
impact predictions of malaria control interventions in close collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme in Tanzania.
I participated in several stakeholder meetings for the revision of the national malaria control strategic plan.
The dynamic and interdisciplinary teamwork with the Tanzanian program managers provided me with insights into local policy and real life contexts; 
and how modelling outputs can be of use in these contexts.

Research interests
======
My research interests are mainly centered around data-driven and evidence-based decision making for targeted deployment of control interventions. 
More specifically I used mathematical modelling to support the national malaria strategic plan in Tanzania.
