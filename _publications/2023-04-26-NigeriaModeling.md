An agent-based model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission was used to simulate malaria morbidity and mortality in Nigeriaâ€™s 774 LGAs 
under four possible intervention strategies from 2020 to 2030. The scenarios represented the previously implemented plan (business-as-usual),
the NMSP at an 80% or higher coverage level and two prioritized plans according to the resources available to Nigeria.
