Using an individual-based mathematical model, allowed to address uncertainties about scheduling PMC alone or in combination with malaria vaccines like RTS,S to provide additional evidence and improved understanding required to accelerate policy adoption of PMC in countries with high malaria burden in children. Simulated PMC with up to seven doses during the first eighteen months of age showed an added benefit in impact against clinical and severe malaria. Across all the PMC schedules tested, there was a complementary effect between PMC and RTS,S, providing a continuum of protection in children under the age of two years.
