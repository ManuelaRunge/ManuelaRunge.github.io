Guinea’s national malaria program employed a subnational tailoring (SNT) approach to optimize its 2024-2026 operational plan by using local data to prioritize malaria interventions by district. 
The SNT team stratified malaria risk and determinants, assessed intervention targeting criteria, and used modeling to predict the impact of various strategies, 
enabling the selection of the most appropriate interventions like indoor residual spray, dual-action nets, and malaria vaccines. 
This data-driven approach successfully mobilized resources and allowed Guinea to adapt its malaria strategy at the district level for the first time.
